If you have python installed, you can do

```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080```

3. Select & Move nodes around
4. Connect nodes

## Know Issues

1. Selecting multiple nodes and moving them breaks the connection

## Next steps

1. Fix issues
2. Refactor code
3. Decide the next milestone?

## Nice to have
